  <h1>Investment property for sale</h1>
  <p>Propellor does not buy and on-sell any of our own properties nor do we charge you for our services. Our sister company Metropolis Real Estate acts for multiple developers with properties to list that may meet your criteria. This ensures a "deep pool" of potential options for you to choose from. Our sister company Metropolis Real Estate is aware of our 21 point investment criteria and understands, that any sale on behalf of a developer will not occur to one of our clients without meeting those standards.Likewise developers are aware of how we operate. In this way, Propellor has access to a diverse and constantly changing portfolio of investment properties for sale all around New Zealand that we believe gives our clients an excellent investment opportunity.</p>
  <p>An Accountant helps and talks through with you, your personalised investment strategy which contains examples of properties potentially suitable for your circumstance. Conservative ten-year projections on these properties showing expected outgoings, income and tax savings are presented. So you can be assured that the property you choose will suit either your personal or financial circumstances.</p>
  <p>We have also collated comprehensive due diligence information on all the investment properties which may be offered to you. Of course, your lawyer and accountant are free to consider all of this material to assist you. We can also recommend a lawyer and an accountant to advise you independently as well.</p>
  <p>We strive to assist you and your team in finding a property that is a solid build, in a proven growth area with an excellent rental return.</p>
